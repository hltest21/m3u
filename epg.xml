        <title>Bob’s Burgers || Aus Bob entspringt ein Fluss</title>
        <desc>Comedyserie. Zum Start der 4. Staffel macht Familie Belcher einen verhängnisvollen Campingtrip.Familienoberhaupt Bob kann es kaum erwarten, sich vollkommen von der Natur zu ernähren – und hat deshalb keine Lebensmittel eingepackt. Zum Glück campen nebenan ein paar Weltuntergangsfanatiker, die großzügig ihre Vorräte teilen. Doch als die Eltern heimlich nackt baden gehen, packt sie der reißende Fluss, und die drei Kinder müssen sich allein durch die gemeingefährliche Wildnis voller Eichhörnchen und Pfadfinder kämpfen… Mehrfach nominiert, gewann die Serie 2014 den Emmy als beste animierte Show. Kurios: Im Original werden sämtliche weiblichen Mitglieder der Belcher-Familie (außer der jüngsten Tochter) von Männern gesprochen.</desc>
